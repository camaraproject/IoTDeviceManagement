# IoTDeviceManagement

Sandbox API Repository to describe, develop, document, and test the IoT Device Management Service API(s). The repository does not yet belong to a CAMARA Sub Project.

* API Repository wiki page: https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/boCeBQ

## Scope

* Service API(s) “IoTDeviceManagement” (see APIBacklog.md) 
* The API(s) provide(s) the API consumer with the ability to:  
  * manage communication functions, like activation and deactivation of voice, SMS, data services, and specific APNs, ensuring precise traffic control to prevent overload. 
  * manage device subscription state, perform operations such as adding, activating, suspending, restoring, deactivating, and deleting IoT cards.  
  * support real-time monitoring, provide visibility into the status of IoT cards, enabling continuous supervision and efficient control of service usage and status. 
* Describe, develop, document, and test the API(s)
* Started: March 2025
<!-- * Incubating stage since: §incubation date$ -->
